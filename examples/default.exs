# Default Firewall
#
# Zone-based default config with sensible out-of-the-box security.
# Two zones: "ext" (external, first physical NIC) and "trusted"
# (loopback + optional internal interface).
#
# What it does:
#   - Blocks IPs in the blocklist at prerouting (ban/unban works immediately)
#   - Drops unsolicited inbound on the external interface
#   - Allows SSH (rate-limited), ICMP, and established connections
#   - Forward and NAT ready for when you add more zones
#
# Customize by adding zones, opening ports, or replacing this
# with a purpose-built config: erlkoenig apply <your_config.exs>
