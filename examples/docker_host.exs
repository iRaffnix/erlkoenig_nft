# Docker / Container Host
#
# Host running containers with published port ranges.
# Zone-based: external traffic is filtered, Docker bridge is trusted.
#
# Zones:
#   ext     (eth0)    — internet-facing, strict inbound
#   docker  (docker0) — Docker bridge network, trusted
#
# Traffic flow:
#   ext -> host:  SSH + container-exposed ports only
#   docker -> ext: allowed + masqueraded (containers reach internet)
#   ext -> docker: only established (no direct inbound to containers)
