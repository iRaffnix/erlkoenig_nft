# NAT Router with Flow Offload
#
# Home/office router doing NAT between LAN (eth1) and WAN (eth0).
# Zone-based forwarding with flowtable offloading for established flows.
#
# Without offload: every packet walks all rules (~2 Gbit/s on commodity hardware)
# With offload:    packets skip nftables entirely (~10 Gbit/s, or line rate with NIC offload)
#
# Zones:
#   wan (eth0) — internet uplink
#   lan (eth1) — local network
#
# The flow offload flowtable binds to both interfaces so established
# flows between LAN and WAN get offloaded at ingress.
