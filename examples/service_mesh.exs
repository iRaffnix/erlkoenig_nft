# Service Mesh Host
#
# Multi-service host using systemd cgroups for per-service firewall rules
# and conntrack marks for cross-chain connection tagging.
# Flowtable offloads established connections for high throughput.
#
# Cgroup IDs are resolved at startup from systemd service names via
# erlkoenig_nft_cgroup:service_id/1 — no hardcoded IDs needed.
#
# Usage:
#   # Find your service cgroup IDs:
#   cat /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/nginx.service/cgroup.id
#
#   # Or from Erlang:
#   {ok, Id} = erlkoenig_nft_cgroup:service_id("nginx").
