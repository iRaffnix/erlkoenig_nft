# Zone-based Home Router
#
# Three zones: WAN (eth0), LAN (eth1 + br0), VPN (wg0).
# Zone-based policies control traffic between interfaces.
# NAT masquerades LAN traffic going out WAN.
#
# The zone macros expand at compile time into standard chains:
#   z_dispatch_input, z_input_wan, z_input_lan, z_input_vpn,
#   z_dispatch_forward, z_fwd_lan_wan, z_fwd_wan_lan, z_fwd_vpn_wan,
#   z_nat_postrouting
#
# No Elixir runtime needed — produces a .term file for erlkoenig_nft.
