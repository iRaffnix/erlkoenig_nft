# Zone-based VPN Gateway
#
# Two zones: WAN (eth0) and VPN (wg0).
# WireGuard clients can access the internet through the gateway.
# Strict inbound policy on WAN — only SSH and WireGuard allowed.
# VPN clients get full forwarding to WAN with NAT.
#
# Replaces the manual vpn_gateway.exs with proper zone-based
# interface matching instead of term-level workarounds.
